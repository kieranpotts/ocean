# Ocean

A family of ocean-themed themes for VS Code.

**These themes are a work in progress and are published only for testing purposes at this time.**

These themes were originally inspired by the "Ocean" theme of Adrien Glitchbone's [base16 terminal color scales generator](https://glitchbone.github.io/vscode-base16-term/#/ocean) for VS Code.
