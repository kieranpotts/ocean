= Theme development

To begin theme development, first run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.

Then follow these steps to start VS Code's extension development environment:

1. Load this repository in Visual Studio Code, directly in its own workspace.

2. Press `F5` to open a new VS Code Extension Development Host window.

3. Go to *File* > *Preferences/Settings* > *Themes* > *Color Themes* and select "Ocean Light".

4. Return to the original VS Code window and make changes to the theme, and use the `npm run build` command to recompile. Alternatively, you can run `npm run dev` to watch for changes and automatically recompile.

Changes to the built artifacts, which are compiled to the `dist` directory, will be automatically loaded in the Extension Development Host window. Sometimes you may need to reload the Extension Development Host window to see the changes â€“ this can be the case when working with mounted drives in WSL, for example.

TIP: Use `npm run dev` to start a development session, during which any changes saved to the `src` files will automatically trigger a rebuild of the extension, which in turn will be hot-reloaded in the Extension Development Host window, if that is open too.

To terminate the extension development session, either close the Extension Development Host window or stop the Run and Debug session in the original window.
