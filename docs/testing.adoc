To test theme changes over the long term before link:./publishing.adoc[publishing] the changes to the VS Code Marketplace, you can package the theme as a VSIX file and install the theme locally.

From the repository root, run the following command:

[source]
----
npm run package
----

This will generate a `.vsix` file in the `pkg` directory. You can install this local extension in VS Code via the *Extension* sidebar > *Install from VSIX...* and select the generated `pkg/ocean-vscode-theme.vsix` file. Then enable the theme by going to *File* > *Preferences/Settings* > *Themes* > *Color Themes* and selecting "Ocean Light". Repeat these steps, and reload VS Code, whenever you make changes to the theme and want to re-test them.
