= Publishing to the VS Code Marketplace

NOTE: These steps assume that the user has an active personal access token (PAT) for the `kieranpotts` organization in Azure DevOps, and the token has the scope "Marketplace (manage)". link:https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension#get-a-personal-access-token[See the VS Code documentation for more information on creating a PAT].

Update the version number in `src/package.json`, then commit the change and tag it. The VS Code Marketplace follows the Semantic Versioning (SemVer) convention.

[source,sh]
----
git commit -am "release: v0.1.0"
git tag v0.1.0
git push && git push --tags
----

To publish the extension:

[source,sh]
----
npm run publish

Type your Personal Access Token at the prompt.
