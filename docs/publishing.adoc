= Publishing to the VS Code Marketplace

:link-get-pat: https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension#get-a-personal-access-token

NOTE: These steps assume that the user has an active personal access token (PAT)
for the `kieranpotts` organization in Azure DevOps, and the token has the scope
"Marketplace (manage)".

{link-get-pat}[See the VS Code documentation] for more information on creating
a PAT.

The publication process is now fully automated using `npm run publish`. All
changes to be included in the release should have been committed before running
this command, and the repository's working directory and staging index should
be clean.

Paste your Personal Access Token, if prompted.
