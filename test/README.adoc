= Tests

This directory contains random source code files for a wide variety of programming, markup and data interchange languages. These files are used to manually test the syntax highlighting of the Ocean theme in Visual Studio Code.

The code samples have been taken from the following sources:

* https://github.com/toddmath/syntax-highlighting-samples
